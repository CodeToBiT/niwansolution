                equipment became commodity. Businesses are reducing the CAPEX
                and OPEX by adopting cloud model. On the other side, it also
                raised serious concern and issue on security and complexity in

                    exclusively dedicate IT infrastructure from end to end (Web,
                    App, DB, OS, Server, Network, SAN, security, compliance,
                    regulation). The cloud infrastructure operates solely for a
                    single organization, whether managed internally or by a
                    third party and hosted internally or externally. . The
                    private cloud project requires a significant level and
                    degree of engagement to virtualize the business environment,
                    and requires the organization to re-evaluate decisions about
                    existing resources, security, reliability, availability, and
                    regulatory compliances. Despite high cost, the vendors chose
                    this model solely for the flexibility, security, and
                    regulatory compliance purpose. The Infrastructure is
                    safeguarded strictly within corporate firewall.

                    <b>Hybrid cloud  :</b>

                    Cloud Himalaya offers the composition of two or more clouds (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities but are bound together, offering the benefits of multiple deployment models. Such composition expands deployment options for cloud services, allowing IT organizations to use public cloud computing resources to meet temporary needs. This capability enables hybrid clouds to employ cloud bursting for scaling across clouds. The TCO is lower than private cloud. This gives benefit on lower TCO by compromising little bit on security and flexibility. One size does not fit  to all organization hence need customization  and combination of private, community, public and hybrid with IaaS, SaaS and PaaS,
